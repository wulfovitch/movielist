movielist
=========

This is a personal rails project which I and my brother are using for tracking our movies we bought on dvd or bluray.

Installation
============

You have to run the migrations first. There is no user registration integrated, because this project is a personal project and there was no need to add one. In order to add a predefined set of users to the database, you have to do the following:

 - open `test/fixtures/users.yml`
 - configure the users which should have access to the system
 - the passwords of the users are stored in an sha1 hash. You can generate your own hashed password by typing `echo -n "YourNewPassword" | openssl sha1` into your Terminal.
 - run `rake db:fixtures:load`

That is all! Have fun with it!
